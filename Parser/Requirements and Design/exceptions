The parameters of a distribution must be explicit nodes in the graph (scalar parameters can also be numerical constants) and so may not be expressions

Data defined by a multivariate distribution must not contain missing (unobserved) values. The only exception to this rule is the multivariate normal distribution.  For multinomial data, it may be possible to get round this problem by re-expressing the multivariate likelihood as a sequence of conditional univariate binomial distributions or as Poisson distributions. 

In general multivariate nodes can not be censored, the multivariate normal distribution is exempted from this restriction.

Data : Nodes with a discrete distribution must in general have integer values. Observed variables having a binomial or Poisson distribution are exempt from this restriction.

Certain parameters of distributions must be constants, that is they can not be learnt. These include both parameters of the Wishart distributions, the order (N) of the multinomial distribution and the threshold (mu) of the generalized Pareto distribution.

A vector-valued logical function can only be used as the sole term on the right hand side of a vector-valued logical relation

A special logical node called "deviance" is created automatically by OpenBUGS : It calculates -2 * log(likelihood), where 'likelihood' is the conditional probability of all data nodes given their stochastic parent nodes. This node can be monitored, and is used in the DIC tool - see DIC... 

However, functions of unobserved nodes are not permitted to appear directly as an index term (intermediate deterministic nodes may be introduced if such functions are required).

Multiple (up to four) variable indices are allowed in setting up mixture models. eg??

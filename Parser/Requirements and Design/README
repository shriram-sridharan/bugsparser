To Know in BUGS:
- Truncation and Censor (Read Bookmark)
- S-plus format for arrays??

Done (but with doubts):
Logical Nodes: mvnode on left side -> Matching everything on the right hand side
Matching ; as WHITESPACE

To Do:
Remove + from model beginning
Note that truncation is currently only an option for the following densities: dbeta(), dcat(), dexp(), dnorm(), dpois(), dt() and dweib().
Add all other functions and distributions
Take out necessary nodenames for Elementary and Interface Elementary (Stage 1)
Take a look at the functions too once again
Take a look at the grammar once again thoroughly
What distributions are we going to support in elementary?

To Do for DATA:
Rules for DATA need to be written
